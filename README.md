Eternal Paradox a fractured universe held together by fragile threads of time.
Each world hides a fragment of the truth, and each step forward bends reality further.

Travel through distorted realms, uncover ancient mechanisms, and gather the lost cores that sustain existence itself.
But with every paradox you stop, another one awakens deeper, stronger, beyond reason.

No path is stable. No world is safe.
Only by crossing them all can you restore balance or become part of the Eternal Paradox.
